In React Native, a less common error occurs when using AsyncStorage with deeply nested objects or arrays.  If you directly store a complex object in AsyncStorage, it will stringify the object, which might lead to unexpected behavior when retrieving it.  When you attempt to parse the retrieved stringified object, you might encounter issues if the structure of the object changes between storage and retrieval, such as adding or removing nested properties.
